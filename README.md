# Random Cube

* I created a cube in Delphi that stores its dimensions (X, Y, Z) and a list of filled cells with random values and their coordinates.
* The cube uses an interface (ICube), so I don’t need to manually free it (FreeAndNil).
* In the main form, the user enters the dimensions, clicks a button, and the program shows the cube’s volume and all the filled positions in a memo.
